# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
  - ### Supervised Learning

	- [Of Genomes And Genetics](https://github.com/aovaldes2/-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Of%20Genomes%20And%20Genetics/notebooks): A model to predict the Genetic disorder with the Disorder subclass of children's. Identified a reliable model for the genetic diagnosis utilizing machine learning. 
	- [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://github.com/aovaldes2/-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Forest_Cover_Type_Prediction.ipynb): The goal of the Project (and competition): to predict seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas of the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado with the best accuracy.
	- [New York City Taxi-Trip Duration](https://github.com/aovaldes2/-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/New_York_City_Taxi_Trip_Duration.ipynb): Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.
	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

  - ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Quora Insincere Questions Classification](https://github.com/aovaldes2/-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/New_York_City_Taxi_Trip_Duration.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NLTK, scikit_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Exploratory Data Analysis projects__ 
		- [Madrid House Price](https://github.com/aovaldes2/-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Madrid%20House%20Price%20EDA/Madrid_RealState.ipynb): Analysis of the different factors that can influence the price of houses in Madrid.
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib_
