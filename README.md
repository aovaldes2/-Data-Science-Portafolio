# -Data-Science-Portfolio

Repository of my data science projects including


* Machine learning projects
* Exploratory data analysis projects
of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Folium, Seaborn and Matplotlib_

	- __R__ 
		- [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS) 2013: Exploratory Data Analysis](http://rpubs.com/sajal_sharma/brfss2013): Exploratory analysis of the BRFSS-2013 data set, focusing on investigating the relationship between education and eating habits, sleep and mental health, and smoking, drinking and general health of a person. 
		- [Inferential Statistics: Do men or women oppose sex education?](http://rpubs.com/sajal_sharma/inferential_statistics) : Using the GSS (General Social Survey) dataset to infer if, in the year 2012, were men, of 18 years or above in the United States, more likely to oppose sex education in public schools than women.
		- [Data Visualization: Corruption and Human Development](http://rpubs.com/sajal_sharma/corruption_viz): A scatter plot for the relationship between the 'Human Development Index' and the 'Corruption Perceptions Index' of countries.
		- [Moneyball: Analysing and replacing lost players](http://rpubs.com/sajal_sharma/moneyball_lost_players): Exploration of baseball data for the year 2001 to look at replacements for key players lost by the Oakland A's in 2001. Inspired by the book/movie: Moneyball.
	

- ### Micro Projects: 

	- __Python__
		- [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb): Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.
		- [ML with K Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/ML%20with%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb): Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
		- [ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests.ipynb): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
		- [Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Recommender%20Systems%20with%20Python.ipynb): A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities. 

	- __R__
		- [ML Logistic Regression](http://rpubs.com/sajal_sharma/micro_logistic): Predicting salary class of a person using logistic regression.
		- [ML Decision Trees and Random Forests](http://rpubs.com/sajal_sharma/micro_dt_rf): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify schools as Private or Public.

I also dabble in all other kinds of technology. You can find a general portfolio [here](https://github.com/sajal2692/general-portfolio/blob/master/README.md).
